"A &slony1; cluster is the basic grouping of database instances in which "
"replication takes place. It consists of a set of &postgres; database "
"instances in which is defined a namespace specific to that cluster. For "
"instance, if the cluster is called <envar>cbcluster</envar>, then &slony1; "
"will define, at the initialization time for each node, a schema called "
"<command>_cbcluster</command>, in which it then creates numerous tables that "
"store &slony1; configuration and replication state information. See <xref "
"linkend=\"schema\"/> for more documentation about what is stored in that "
"schema. More specifically, the tables &sllog1; and &sllog2; log changes "
"collected on the origin node as they are replicated to subscribers."

"Note that, as recorded in the <xref linkend=\"faq\"/> under <link linkend="

"has been set up."

"Some planning should be done, in more complex cases, to ensure that the "
"numbering system is kept sane, lest the administrators be driven insane. The "
"node numbers should be chosen to somehow correspond to the shape of the "
"environment, as opposed to (say) the order in which nodes were initialized."

"the scenes so that <xref linkend=\"slonik\"/> scripts can use names for "
"nodes rather than cryptic numbers."
