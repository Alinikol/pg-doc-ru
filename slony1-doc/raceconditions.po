"No, this has nothing to do with racial harmony or lack thereof; the <ulink "
"url=\"http://www.wikipedia.org/\"> Wikipedia </ulink> describes it thus: "
"<quote>A race condition or race hazard is a flaw in a system or process "
"whereby the output of the process is unexpectedly and critically dependent "
"on the sequence or timing of other events. </quote> In computing "
"applications, race conditions arise most frequently in distributed or "
"threaded applications when multiple parts of the application depend on some "
"piece of shared state, and, if this state is not properly managed, confusion "
"(error!) arises. More particularly, this usually involves situations where "
"the state can change between the time it was checked and the time of use of "
"the state."

"problem that nodes did not have any way to prevent them from processing "

"The &lslon; option <xref linkend=\"slon-config-sync-interval-timeout\"/> is "
