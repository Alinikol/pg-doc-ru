"in the replication system they are called. The absence of named parameters "
"for stored procedures makes it rather hard to do this from the "

"typically be <emphasis>generated</emphasis> by scripts, such as Bash or "
"Perl, and these sorts of scripting languages already have perfectly good "
"ways of managing variables, doing iteration, and such."
